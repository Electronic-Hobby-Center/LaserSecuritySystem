# LaserSecuritySystem
Laser based Security System is a type of security and alarm system that uses laser light and a light sensor. A security system protects our homes, offices, banks, lockers etc.

How L.S.S works ::
There are three essential components to a laser security system: a laser, a detector and sensing electronics. The laser is a concentrated light source that puts out a straight line "pencil beam" of light of a single color. The detector is sensitive to light and puts out a voltage when the laser light hits it. The detector is connected to the sensing electronics. When the laser beam is interrupted and can't reach the detector, its voltage output changes, and the electronics sense the change and put out a warning signal.
